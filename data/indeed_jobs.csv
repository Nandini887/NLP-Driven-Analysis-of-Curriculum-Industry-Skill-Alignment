Recognizing new challenges and opportunities, in 2019 we set our sights on EV battery upcycling-addressing one of the industry’s most pressing issues. Our engineering team pioneered solutions to extend EV battery life, pushing the boundaries of sustainable innovation.

Recognizing that demand for solar panels would exceed availability and 100,000 tons of waste would potentially go into landfills by 2035, our team searched for an innovative way to upcycle solar panels. With an eye on the future, we developed ways to upcycle solar panels.

Rooted in family and community values, we’re proud to have second-generation employees contributing to our legacy. Backed by Clearlake Capital, we’ve expanded our footprint into Europe with facilities in Spain, Italy, Denmark, Germany and Poland. We now sustainably manufacture and supply an assortment of nondiscretionary repair parts across more than 90 countries.

ERP Business Analyst
SO HERE’S THE DEAL…
We’re not a regular tech company, we’re a “cool” tech company and we do things our way. You may be accustomed to tech companies that work with their “heads down” and give you a small piece of the big picture to “own” but at Northlake Partners (NLP) working as a team and taking ownership are in our DNA – or rather, in our core values (they’re literally two of our four core values). So, to us, being collaborative and supporting each other is more important than throwing on some headphones, keeping to yourself and grinding out your work all alone – although to be fully transparent, that does happen from time to time. To us, “owning” a small piece of the big picture doesn’t really allow you to take ownership if you don’t have the big picture to see where your piece fits in and how it can be improved. So instead, we want everyone to know where we’re going, why we’re going there and to own their part in making it happen. We are a remote company but that doesn’t stop us from being engaged with one another and working as a team. If you believe people should be enriched at work and you love to serve people, you’re our kind of people – so keep reading!
CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED…
This job is going to be hard. We’re a small company that works on big projects, which means a lot of opportunity to learn (yay!) but it also means it never gets boring, so you need to be committed to the cause and believe what we believe (re: last sentence in section above). The team members that are the most successful here are the ones that enjoy being in the trenches and fighting their way out, facing problems head on and figuring out the best solution. The most successful team members are the ones who are vocal and unafraid to speak up when they have an idea or opinion but are humble enough to recognize when someone else’s idea or opinion is better and will commit themselves to following through with the best idea no matter who or where it came from. They’re the “doers” that are driven, self-motivated, resourceful, curious, constantly seeking new knowledge and want to succeed and grow. But that’s not all! They’re also the ones who play well with others and are communicative, dependable, honest and perceptive of others.
No day will be the same because our “jobs” change daily. But don’t worry, you’ll know what will be expected of you. In fact, you can know right now if you keep reading!
WHAT WE’LL EXPECT OF YOU…
A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN ERP BUSINESS ANALYST
Most of your time each day will be spent interacting with customers by helping them use the software more effectively, working on implementation tasks, and troubleshooting issues.
In a typical week, you will work closely with our:
Implementation Team to help train, support, and implement NorthScope software.
Development team to escalate software bugs or areas of the software we can improve.
Product Manager to ensure customer requests are added to the development roadmap.
Customers and Implementation team to perform SQL Traces, software upgrades and other general maintenance.
Not every help request comes with perfect information, so this role requires you to be able to think like a business analyst when information is not complete. Someone will excel in this role if they are the type that likes to take on a messy problem from a customer with minimal information and return it solved in a clear and concise manner and enjoys this while working both alone and part of a team.

WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT OF US…
Our mission is to build better software so you can build a better business and the “you” refers to both our customers and our team members.
For our customers, this means that as a team we provide ERP software (it’s called NorthScope) and step-by-step guidance, giving them the tools to build the business they’ve always wanted. We take away their pain points by listening to their problems and coming up with the best, most efficient, long-term solutions. Our mission isn’t to simply snag the next deal, it’s to help our customers succeed and to be the best vendor they work with. We always exceed their expectations while providing them the best software solutions that make them more efficient.
As a company, we don’t hire “employees,” we hire team members that think and act like independent business owners. We invest in this mindset by providing training, tools and the opportunity for growth and success. We empower team members and expect everyone to have a voice, even if what they have to say is outside the “parameters” of their job title. We believe the best way to grow our company is to simultaneously grow each team member’s individual “business,” making this a dynamic place to work.
And each day, we live out our mission through our core values:
We work as a team: Our job titles aren’t there to keep us in “lanes” but to highlight the individual skillsets that make up our team. We’re a team working towards the same goal, so we win together or lose together. Everyone’s contribution is vital, so we don’t let the team down or expect others to pick up our slack. When someone’s struggling, we help them and don’t worry about who gets the credit. We don’t tolerate anything that damages our team including poor work results, gossip and negativity.
We serve our customers: We exist to make our customers’ lives better and this starts with building great software. Our software is the tool our customers spend their entire workday using, so making this better directly impacts their ability to perform their jobs happily, successfully, and efficiently. However, we don’t stop at software. If it’s within our ability, we do whatever is necessary to serve our customers and make their lives better.
We take ownership: This isn’t just a “J-O-B” – we all work like we own the place. As owners, we’re not just focused on what we deliver but on how we conduct ourselves, the level of personal accountability, and how we represent the company. We’re here to serve our customers, contribute to the team, and exceed expectations, not simply to occupy a seat. This means we take pride in our work and hold ourselves accountable so we’re here when scheduled, we don’t miss deadlines, and we’re always looking for ways to improve.
We exceed expectations: Everything we do matters to someone so we always aim for excellence, no matter how small or insignificant a task may seem. Our work is high quality and delivered correctly, the first time. We constantly challenge ourselves and other team members to improve and become better versions of ourselves. Our team members are honest, ethical and of high character and we honor commitments and treat others with respect.
Oh, you can also expect us to provide competitive pay and benefits. We anticipate the annual compensation to be anywhere from $85 to $1055k annually, made up of a base salary plus bonuses.
Don’t worry, we won’t stop you there – if you want to earn above average pay you have to be above average.), generous PTO, paid holidays, 40-hour weeks, a challenging workplace, medical, dental and vision, short-term and long-term disability, 401k with employer match, profit sharing and opportunities for growth.

The Accounting & Finance department is looking for a Sr. Business Analyst to join their dynamic team. With core values that focus on integrity, accountability, and togetherness, you'll be surrounded by tenured employees who love coming to work every day and have spent their entire careers here - a testament to the company's positive reputation and culture that supports long-term well-being.
The Sr. Business Analyst position has been crafted for someone who craves autonomy. You enjoy coming to work, locking in, and owning your projects from start to finish. You're the type of person who says ""I've got this"" and your team fully trusts that you're going to deliver. You've always thought you're wired a bit differently than others - you're constantly brainstorming new ideas and figuring out a more efficient way to do something. For a well-established company, this Accounting & Finance team is incredibly nimble. It does not take five Zoom meetings, a written proposal, and numerous follow up conversations to implement change. The team would LOVE someone who is excited about automation, AI, and other forms of technology modernization. Your drive for process improvement is what will make you stand out.
Performance expectations and how success is measured is incredibly clear. The team is in need for a data guru - you are someone that can leverage SQL to pull data sets, perform data validation, and deliver data that can be trusted for decision making. Project management and organization skills are key - you'll be coordinating with important internal and external parties, so responsiveness and clear communication are essential. Experience in financial services and working within an Accounting & Finance department will allow you to assess whether the data fields you are pulling and evaluating makes sense. Supervisory experience would be helpful, as you'll coach and mentor an analyst and intern, but not required. The company is open to a high potential individual who has the skillset to get the job done and wants to grow into a mentorship position for staff.
Don't expect this role to be the same in five years - the need for data is constantly evolving, so the right hire is adaptable and eager to learn. If you’re looking for a company where you can grow, thrive, and make a lasting impact, reach out today to learn more.

Rooted in family and community values, we’re proud to have second-generation employees contributing to our legacy. Backed by Clearlake Capital, we’ve expanded our footprint into Europe with facilities in Spain, Italy, Denmark, Germany and Poland. We now sustainably manufacture and supply an assortment of nondiscretionary repair parts across more than 90 countries.

As we move forward under the TERREPOWER name, we remain committed to the same values that have always defined us: entrepreneurship, teamwork, customer-centered, sustainability, safety.
